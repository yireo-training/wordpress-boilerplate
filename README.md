# wordpress-boilerplate
Boilerplate for setting up WordPress

## Status
This repository is just an example setup for training purposes. Use it at your own risk.

## Usage
Copy the files in the repository to your own project. Next, use composer to setup resources:

  composer install

This copies WordPress in the `wp` folder, while third party plugins and themes are stored in `wp-content`.

Next copy `local-config-sample.php` to `local-config.php` and modify it. Then install WordPress.
